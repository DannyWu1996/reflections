How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?


It just shows me the exact line which is different from the old version. 
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?




By using these version control systems, we can almost manage every version of the file, and it's a great way for us to be a more effiecient programmer.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?


manully chooisng whether to create a commit seems more inconvinient, it needs us to judge when to create a commit, but it also seems more flexible when we want to check the diff of two commit compares to automatically saved can cause trouble when checking two commits.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
